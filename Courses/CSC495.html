        <p class='lead'>Odyssey Pickup Assistant</p>
        <p>Mockups for Odyssey Pickup Assistant. This web application was developed by the NCC CSC 495 Spring 2016 class for Sharing Connections to aid them with their daily processes. While the site linked here is not a live site, the mockups are an accurate representation of application. My part in the team was to develop the front-end aspects of the application, from the design to basic functionality, while the Ruby coders handled all the back-end and logic.
