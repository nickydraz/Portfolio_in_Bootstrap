# Portfolio Site V2
New version of portfolio site using Bootstrap

This is a new version of my personal portfolio page. The old version (ndraz.com) used a minimalistic version of Bootstrap. 
This new version uses actual Bootstrap to give it a better look and feel.
I will also be using Javascript, PHP, and JQuery to handle functionality.

Actual course project files have been hidden from this repository, as some of them contain sensitive information. 
Eventually, I will set up another repository with clean version of all the projects, with no sensitive information.


# Things To Do
- Add more course projects to Course page.
- Add About page.
- Find out way to showcase projects that are .exe, such as those in CSC 425
- Add some more style to the page. It's a bit bland.
